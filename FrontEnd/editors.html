    <h1>Editors and Curators of the Reptile Database
    </h1>

    <p>The Reptile Database requires the contributions of numerous individuals. Over the past few years a certain
        organization structure has been established (see figure). While Dr. Peter Uetz acts as the "editor in chief",
        the Scientific Advisory Board (see below), composed primarily of professional taxonomists, advises on broand
        strategic and taxonomic decisions. Specialized editors help with the processing of photos and the scientific
        literature. Equally important, numerous volunteers and ad hoc contributors provide photos, papers, and numerous
        small corrections that add up to
        thousands of changed in the database over every year.</p>

    <p>Editors organize and coordinate the curation of photos and the herpetological literature.</p>

        <h3>Photo Editors</h3>
        <p>Photo editors manage the photos we receive by reformatting, labeling, and processing them for display in the
            Reptile Database.</p>
        <ul>

        <h3>Taxonomic Editors</h3>
        <p>Taxonomic editors (curators) are responsible for extracting key data from scientific papers within their area
            of expertise to be incorporated into the database. This includes new locality records, name changes, and
            other taxonomic changes.</p>

        <h3>Instructions for Literature Editors / Curators</h3>
        <p>Literature Editors have two different (and separable) responsibilities, i.e. you can chose one or both of
            these:</p>
        <p><b>A. Collecting bibliographic information.</b> This simply involves the collection of new publications by
            following journals and sending bibliographic information in a structured format to the database. Publication
            editors can follow certain journals or publishers, e.g. via email Table of Contents, websites, Twitter feeds
            etc. If they find publications relevant to the Reptile Database, their bibliographic information will be
            submitted to the Reptile Database in a tabular format (Excel spreadsheet) with 6 columns, so we can easily
            import this information into the database:</p>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>author (e.g. "Streicher, Jeffrey W.; Jay P. McEntee, Laura C. Drzich, Daren C. Card, Drew R. Schield,
                Utpal Smart, Christopher L. Parkinson, Tereza Jezkova, Eric N. Smith and Todd A. Castoe")</li>
            <li>year (e.g. "2016)</li>
            <li>title (e.g. "Genetic surfing, not allopatric divergence, explains spatial sorting of mitochondrial
                haplotypes in venomous coralsnakes.")</li>
            <li>source (e.g."Evolution 70 (7): 1435â€“1449, DOI: 10.1111/evo.12967,)</li>
            <li>URL (e.g."http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12967/abstract")</li>
            <li>email (of the corresponding or any other author).</li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>B. Curation of the literature.</b> Curators read papers and send key information to the database in a
            structured format, so it can be integrated into the current data. This involves primarily taxonomically
            relevant information (e.g. new names, synonyms, distribution etc.), but may also include any other
            information, e.g. on reproduction, diet, or others. We currently do not systematically collect information
            on behavior or ecology although such data may be included in the future. Let us know if you are interested
            in these subjects.</p>
    </section>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>1. Checklists and surveys. These are the easiest cases: just compare a checklist to the checklist you obtain from
        the Reptile Database. For instance, Rovito et al. 2015 have a checklist for a part of Costa Rica (Rovito et al
        2015 First survey of the amphibians and reptiles of the Nectandra Cloud Forest Reserve, Alajuela, Costa Rica.
        Check List 11 (2): 1570.
    <p>You can get a checklist of Costa Rican herps by just searching the database for distribution = Costa Rica. You
        would then have to compare that list to the one in the Rovito paper. Alternatively, you can search the database
        for the province discussed in the paper (Alajuela). Currently the database has only 4 species listed for this
        province, although the paper lists 14. That is, you would send us an email saying, "please add the province
        Alajuela to the following Costa Rican species: A, B, C, ...".</p>
    <p>2. Phylogenetics papers. You would send us a list of species that are included in a phylogenetic analysis, i.e.
        included in some sort of phylogenetic tree. If the authors make taxonomic changes, tell us what has been
        changed, e.g. "SILER et al. 2013 and GUO et al. 2013 synonymized Dinodon with Lycodon ". Make sure to send us a
        list of species, e.g. the species of Dinodon explicitly synonymized and/or included in the phylogenetic study.
        Often authors do NOT provide species lists but simply synonymize genera wholesale (which is fine if there is a
        consensus what belongs to the genus, but often this is not the case).
    </p>
    <p>3. Biology papers. If papers make statements about the biology, e.g. reproduction, let us know what they say. For
        instance, the reproductive biology of Atractus reticulatus could be summarized as follows:
    </p>
    <div class='x'>
        <p> Reproduction: oviparous. Sexual maturity: males: 8-10 months (SVL ca. 198 mm) and females: 11-12 months (SVL
            ca. 242 mm). The reproductive period begins in late August, with clutches laid in November, December and
            January, and hatching occurring from January to March. clutch size: 1 to 3 (Lucchesi-Balestrin & Di-Bernardo
            2005).
        </p>
        <p> Reference:</p>

        <p>Lucchesi-Balestrin & Di-Bernardo (2005) Reproductive biology of Atractus reticulatus (BOULENGER 1885)
            (Serpentes, Colubridae) in Southern Brazil. Herp. J. 15: 195-199
        </p>
        <p>Note that this paper also provides information about sizes and other aspects of biology, which should be
            extracted as well.</p>
    </div>
    <p> 4. Photos. Even if you are not a photo editor your help with photos regarding certain taxa or geographic areas
        is important.</p>
