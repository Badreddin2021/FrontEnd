    <p>This database provides a catalogue of all living reptile species and their classification. The database covers
        all living snakes, lizards, turtles, amphisbaenians, tuataras, and crocodiles. Currently there are more than
        10,000 species including another 2,800 subspecies (statistics). The database focuses on taxonomic data, i.e.
        names and synonyms, distribution and type data and literature references. There is not much other information in
        the database, such as ecological or behavioural information, although we are working to add such data. The
        database has no commercial interest and therefore depends on contributions from volunteers. Most of our data
        comes from published sources which is curated with help from our editors. The Scientific Advisory Board (SAB)
        advises us with contentious taxonomic decisions.</p>

    <section id="what-is-a-reptile">
        <h2>What is a reptile?</h2>
        <p>Traditionally reptiles are lizards, snakes, turtles, and crocodiles as well as the less obvious groups of
            tuataras and amphisbaenians. These groups are also covered by this database. But strictly speaking, reptiles
            are not that easy to define. Phylogenetically reptiles are not an isolated evolutionary lineage like birds.
            In fact, crocodiles are more closely related to birds than to lizards, so the birds should be part of the
            reptile class as well. Or the crocodiles should be considered as birds! For a more detailed discussion check
            out the Tree of Life page on amniotes, the CNAAR page on vertebrate taxonomy, or the Wikipedia page on
            reptiles. By the way - this database and Wikipedia are quite heavily cross-referenced.</p>

However, in some studies (Mallat & Winchell 2007) turtles formed a clade separate from squamates and crocodiles and thus complicate the situation a bit more. Snakes nest within lizards (here represented by "Iguana").</p>

    <section id="source-information">
        <h2>Where does the information in the database come from?</h2>
        <p>Originally, we used a number of books, checklists, and monographs as a starting point for the database. About a quarter of the data has been provided directly by contributors in either electronic or paper form (i.e., reprints etc.). Most data comes from journal articles or books as cited in the species entries. Users are encouraged to send us updates or reprints if they notice any omissions or errors.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="identify-species">
        <h2>How can I identify a species using the database?</h2>
        <p>The database does not currently allow searches for species characters. However, if you know the origin of a specimen, you may simply search the DISTRIBUTION field for the country (or state in some cases) and the FAMILY field for a higher taxon, e.g., "turtle", "snake", or "Polychrotidae" (if it looks like an anole). While there are no common names for families yet in the database, you can look up the scientific name on the Higher Taxa page. Combining different criteria in one search should narrow down your choices to a few species for most countries. You can help improve this feature by submitting photos to info@reptile-database.org.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="new-taxonomies-species-concepts">
        <h2>How does the database deal with new taxonomies and species concepts?</h2>
        <p>As Thiele and Yeates (Nature 419, 337; 2002) and many other authors have highlighted, species and other taxa are hypotheses, not facts. We try to reflect different opinions by mentioning them in the database or on the family pages. We are somewhat conservative regarding new taxonomic concepts, mainly because these hypotheses often change with each new DNA sequence that becomes available. We typically wait to see if proposed changes gain wider acceptance in the literature. We also adhere to the biological species concept, as we believe that DNA sequences alone cannot define species due to their inability to predict reproductive or ecological characteristics. Significant genetic differences do not necessarily imply reproductive isolation. Thus, do not be surprised if the database does not immediately follow each elevation of subspecies to species level, although we may adopt changes that gain broader acceptance by independent authors. Note that assignments of species to different or new genera are initially listed in the synonyms field, indicating a "probation period" until the name gains official recognition by the scientific community.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="literature-database-completeness">
        <h2>How complete is the literature database? Can it replace the Zoological Record or BIOSIS?</h2>
        <p>The literature in the database is complete for all species descriptions (at least those that are still valid), fairly complete for taxonomic changes, and incomplete for non-taxonomic literature. If you are seeking literature on the behavior, ecology, or husbandry of reptiles, you should use other resources such as the Zoological Record or BIOSIS.</p>

    <section id="database-management">
        <h2>Who runs the database?</h2>
        <p>Editor and curator in charge is Peter Uetz, an associate professor of biology at Virginia Commonwealth University. The database software is maintained by Jiri Hosek. Photos are managed by Paul Freed, who has also contributed more than 1,100 photos of almost 900 species to the Reptile Database. Rocio Aguilar is the Social Media editor and manages the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts. All team members are unpaid and volunteer as they run the database, but the database depends even more on a large number of additional volunteers as regular contributors, including the curation team (who reads scientific papers and extracts the gist of them), as well as Barry Baker, Jirka Schmidt, and a number of Wikipedia authors. Although we are not a wiki, contributions are always welcome! And we do have a page on Wikipedia!</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="database-history">
        <h2>A short history of the Reptile Database</h2>
        <p>Peter Uetz founded the database when he was a graduate student at EMBL in 1995. He simply took advantage of a group of people who ran the EMBL DNA sequence database and essentially used their technology. By the end of 2006, everybody who was originally involved in the database had left EMBL, and so the lab was not willing to support it anymore. In early 2007, the database moved to a new server at TIGR, now the JCVI, which ceased to support the database in July 2010. The database itself has been hosted by reptarium.cz since then. See also Uetz et al. 2021 for more details.</p>

    <section id="update-schedule">
        <h2>Update Schedule</h2>
        <p>The web database is updated every 3 months or so. Depending on submissions from contributors, the amount of
            updated material may differ. But usually hundreds of species records get edited and dozens of references
            added in each new release. The date of the latest update is given on the Home Page headline or on the News
            Page.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="citation-guide">
        <h2>How can I cite the database?</h2>
        <p>There are several ways of citing the database, either by citing one of the papers about the database, e.g.</p>

    <section id="extinct-taxa">
        <h2>Extinct Taxa (Dinosaurs and subfossil species)</h2>
        <p>Are not covered by this database. A few taxa are included in the Living Reptiles database that most likely
            have become extinct only recently (i.e. since the Pleistocene or during human history). They can be found by
            searching for the term "extinct" in the Comments field.</p>

    <section id="contributions">
        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p>The usefulness of this database depends on your contributions. Send us an e-mail:
            submit@reptile-database.org.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="photo-contributions">
        <h2>HOW TO CONTRIBUTE PHOTOS</h2>
        <p>We are always interested in good photos, especially of species which are not yet pictured in the database.
            Note that you should be the owner of the photograph or obtain permission from the photographer. Ideally you
            should also include a copyright statement right in the photo including a locality where the picture was
            taken. Finally, JPGs should have a minimum size of about 800 x 600 pixels (original files are fine, we can
            process them). If you can, please take photos of an animal from multiple sides, ideally whole animal and
            close-up of head from the side and the top, plus additional details. Often details are required for proper
            identification. Please send photos to photos@reptile-database.org.</p>
