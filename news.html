    <h2>28 March 2024 -- new release</h2>

    <p>This update has 12,162 species (up from 12,060 reptile species in the October 2023 release), plus another 2,118
        subspecies (excluding nominate subspecies), that is, a total of 14,280 taxa. 102 new entries have been added to
        the release, as well as a total of 123 species-level changes, with 79 new species and 2 new genera (Dravidoseps,
        and Pseudoindotyphlops). We also synonymized or downgraded 5 species (to subspecies). 28 species were elevated
        from subspecies or resurrected from synonymy. As always, you can find a complete list of changes as part of our
        checklist, available at on our download page. The checklist also contains 22 new species that were added after
        our deadline and thus did not make it into the web database.</p>
    <p>Literature database. We have added 695 references to the database since October, which now stands at 67,187
        references, 55,113 of which have links to online (or sometimes other) sources (such as publisher websites).</p>
    <p>Photos. This release contains 21,041 photos of 6,473 species (previous release: 6,388 species, plus 85 species),
        or 53% of all species. 50 photographers have sent us 350 photos since the last release (almost the same number
        as in the last release, so the stream of submitted photos is fairly constant). The new photos represent 143
        species. These photographers are as follows (people with more than 10 photos in bold): Ali Gholamifard (1),
        Apostolos Christopoulos (20), Boris Tuniyev (6), César Luis Barrio Amorós (32), Crispian Emberson (1), Daniel

        Krasylenko (2). As always, thank you for your invaluable contributions!</p>
    <p>Reference image library. It’s great to have photos of live reptiles, but it’s often necessary to have
        standardized images of preserved museum specimens in order to compare them or to see specific details, often not
        visible in live photos (e.g. the ventral side of an animal). We started to create a reference database of images
        to make such comparisons possible, based on more than 14,000 photos of more than 1,000 species from 20
        collections. We will integrate that material into the Reptile Database over the next few months, but for now,
        you can read about and access these images through this preprint:
        https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.08.584020v1 . High-resolution images will be available from
        Morphobank shortly.</p>
    <p>Snake types on Facebook. Complementary to the aforementioned effort, Masud Salimian has created about 1,300
        Facebook pages dedicated to type specimens of snakes. We have cross-referenced these pages through the Reptile
        Database. If there is a Facebook page, you can find the link at the bottom of our species pages, e.g. for
        Leptodeira bakeri RUTHVEN, 1936. We do not have a photo of this species, but the Facebook page does:

    <p>Etymologies: with etymologies for 9,631 species, we are approaching the magic 10,000 species mark. Glenn Shea
        helped to reach the current level (from 9,057 in the last release) by contributing etymologies for those
        Australian species for which we did not have any. If you have an interest in names, please let us know, we have
        about 2,500 species to go, including some quite mysterious ones. For example, only recently did Charles Klaver
        (likely) solve the mystery of the African species names Congolacerta vauereselli and Buhoma vauerocegae whose
        etymology was not explained by their author, Gustav Tornier. Klaver argued that they are wordplays on the
        letters V, R, S, L (or O and C, apparently standing for Vertebrata, Reptilia, Sauria, Lacertidae and Ophidia,
        Colubridae) as pronounced in German (Klaver 2022). Who would have thought!?</p>
    <p>Descriptions. Given our ongoing lack of funding, we had to cut down on our efforts to provide species
        descriptions. Hence we will only provide short diagnoses until the situation improves, currently 6,821 species
        (56.1% of all species). We are happy to provide more data for collaborators though. Please contact us for
        details.</p>
    <p>More trait databases. On top of our own efforts to collect images and species descriptions, there are several new
        projects and datasets describing ecological and other traits, including SquamBase and ReptTraits created by Shai
        Meiri and colleagues. They should nicely complement each other and the Reptile Database.</p>
    <p>Maps. If you ever wondered why we do not have maps, you simply missed them! If you need a range map of a species,
        just click the link to the IUCN Red List — the linked pages have maps for about 10,000 species. Here is an
        example for Compsophis laphystius, with the map on this page:
        <br>https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/172862/6931512 (it may take a few seconds for the polygon to load).

    <p>New checklists: This release integrates recently published checklists about Nicaragua (Sunyer et al. 2023) and
        the Mexican states of Nayarit (Loc-Barragán et al. 2024), and Querétaro (Tepos-Ramírez et al. 2023).</p>
    <p>Climate change and reptile extinctions. There has been a flurry of studies on the impact of climate change on
        reptile populations world-wide. For instance, Biber et al. 2023 project a 9% decrease of species richness per
        grid cell globally (equivalent to 5 species) until 2080. Murali et al. 2023 evaluated the impact of climate
        change on land vertebrates but it remains unclear how that will affect their survival. Etard & Newbold 2024
        presented a similar analysis and found that narrower ranges, narrower habitat breadth, and inability to exploit
        artificial habitats, unsurprisingly, were associated with more negative land-use responses and with higher
        climate-change sensitivity. Wiens & Zelinka 2024 presented another, more global analysis, and predict
        climate-related extinction of 14%– 32% of macroscopic species in the next ~50 years. Given the uncertainties
        about the human impact on nature, we are organizing two zoom meetings to discuss exactly this topic. Please join
        us next week on
        <br>Thu, Apr 4, 7 pm EDT (UTC -4): https://vcu.zoom.us/j/83636474633, or
        <br>Sun, Apr 7, 11 am EDT (UTC -4), https://vcu.zoom.us/j/83061396121

    <p>WCH and (Bio-) Diversity meetings. We will be at the World Conference of Herpetology this coming August, in case
        you want to meet or collaborate. In fact, we are planning to organize some herping trips on Borneo and elsewhere
        in Indonesia in the weeks before the meeting, so let us know if you want to join us. One such trip is
        co-organized by Andrew Durso (amdurso@gmail.com). Indonesians and Malaysians are especially invited to join, of
        course.

        <br>If Borneo is too far or WCH too expensive, please consider to attend the electronic (Bio-) Diversity meeting
        (organized by MDPI and its Diversity journal) in October 2024. The meeting is organized by Michael Wink,
        completely online and completely free for both presenters and attendees! Not traveling will save a ton of CO2
        too :

        <br>Spawls, Stephen; Tomáš Mazuch & Abubakr Mohammad (2023) Handbook of Amphibians and Reptiles of North-east
        Africa. Bloomsbury, 640 pp. This is yet another monumental effort by Steve Spawls and co-authors to cover the
        herpetofauna of a huge African region, this time ranging from Egypt to Somalia. Spawls et al. cover 461 species
        of reptiles with detailed descriptions, color photos and maps for almost all species, as well as keys to those
        species. Given the vast coverage, the photos and maps are relatively small, but usually sufficient to see enough
        details. For a subset of species such as blindsnakes, they also provide drawings of the head scalation as this
        is usually impossible to see on photos of whole animals. If you are interested in the herpetofauna of Eastern
        North Africa, this is a must-have.

        <br>Lillywhite, H.B & Martins, M. (eds.) (2023) Islands and Snakes. Vol. II. Oxford University Press, ca. 340
        pp. According to Martins & Lillywhite there are 1,300 species of snakes inhabiting more than 1,000 islands
        worldwide. Many of those were covered in their first volume in this series and volume II adds another 15 chapers
        on the topic. Eight chapters focus on certain islands, including giants like Borneo and New Guinea, but also
        smaller islands such as Trinidad and Tobago, the Izu islands of Japan, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, islands
        in the Gulf of Mexico, Galapagos, and tiny ones such as Golem Grad (North Macedonia). Five chapters focus on
        certain species or taxonomic groups, such as lanceheads (Bothrops), cottonmouths (Agkistrodon conanti), the
        Viperine Snake (Natrix maura) or Garter snakes (Thamnophis). Finally, two chapters are about more general
        topics, including invasive snakes on islands and conservation of snakes on islands more generally. Just the
        aforementioned islands have about 400 species (!) and the more general topics cover many more, making this book
        (and its predecessor) a must-read for everybody interested in snakes on islands.
