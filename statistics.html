    <h1>STATISTICS</h1>
    <h2>SPECIES NUMBERS (as of March 2024)</h2>

    <p>The tables below give you an idea how many species* of reptiles are known. About 200 species have been described
        in each of the previous years and therefore the real number changes continuously. See The original descriptions
        of reptiles (and their subspecies) for a historical analysis. Note also that currently <b>922 reptile
            species</b> have
        a total of <b>2,118 subspecies</b>. Some authors reject the idea of subspecies and either synonymize them with
        their
        parent species or consider them as valid species (e.g. Wallach et al. 2014, Snakes of the World).</p>

    <p><b>Number of families:</b> As of March 2024 there are <b>93 families</b> of reptiles (see our taxonomic overview
        and the
        phylogenetic tree of squamates for lists). Note that this number is a bit arbitrary, depending on what is called
        a family (sometimes a subfamily).</p>
    <p><b>Number of genera:</b> As of March 2024 there are <b>1249 genera</b> of reptiles. See our downloadable
        spreadsheet for a complete list.</p>

    <p id="bottom">* What exactly is a "species"? A species may contain many individuals of different appearance
        ("variations") but as long as they interbreed they can exchange genetic information and therefore form a genetic
        continuum. This biological species concept is increasingly challenged by the "evolutionary species concept"
        which rather considers populations of very similar specimens as species. As a result, many subspecies have been
        raised to "full species" status and therefore the number of species increases just because of that.</p>
